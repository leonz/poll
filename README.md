Basic Description:

"Make a Poll" is a website that allows visitors to create a radio or checkbox poll.  The interface to create the poll will be on the front page and will not require any registration or other action.  After creating the poll, which will be located at a unique URL, the user will be given the option to create an account.  The account page will allow a user to keep track of, delete, and view statistics for his/her polls.




Index Page:

This will contain the skeleton of a poll that a visitors can modify inline.  An option will be given to transform between radio and checkbox.  A link when clicked will cause more poll options to appear.

After the poll is created, the user will be redirected to the poll page with an additional message to register and save their work.

There will be a button to login at the bottom of the page, but registration is only after creating the first poll.

Possible inclusion of anti-spam?



Poll Page:

This page will be the permanent home for the poll, showing options to users and if a cookie claims that they have already answered, the results.

If the creator is being redirected to the poll page, an additional "Success" message will appear and they will be asked to register or login to save their work.

Poll URL will be created using a base 62 key.

Add an option to share the poll on Facebook with friends.

Register either by inputting an email address and password or by connecting through Facebook.



Login page:
